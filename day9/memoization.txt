 MLP Memoization | Complete Deep Learning Playlist

 1. Introduction
- Focus on Memoization:
  - Technique used in computer science and data science to optimize programs.
  - Particularly useful in the development of machine learning algorithms, especially in gradient descent.
- Explanation and Application:
  - The video will explain the concept of memoization and its application in gradient descent.
  - Addresses the complexity of calculating derivatives for neural networks with multiple hidden layers, focusing on the first layer.
- Importance:
  - Understanding memoization is emphasized as important for future videos in the series.

 2. What is Memoization?
- Optimization Technique:
  - Memoization optimizes computer programs by storing the results of expensive function calls.
  - Allows the program to retrieve stored results instead of recalculating them when the same input is encountered again.
- Benefits and Trade-offs:
  - Speeds up program execution by reducing the number of calculations.
  - Requires additional storage space for storing calculated results.
- Common Usage:
  - Commonly used in dynamic programming, which solves problems by breaking them down into smaller subproblems.

 3. Code Demo - Fibonacci Sequence
- Initial Inefficiency:
  - Discussed in the context of the Fibonacci sequence.
  - Initial code implementation is inefficient due to repeated calculations, leading to a time complexity of O(2^n).
- Introduction of Memoization:
  - Memoization solves this inefficiency by storing previously calculated Fibonacci values in a dictionary (or hash table) to avoid redundant computations.
  - Memoized code checks if a value is already present in the dictionary before calculating it, reducing the time complexity to O(n).
- Benefits:
  - Dramatic reduction in execution time for larger input values.
- Related Technique:
  - Dynamic programming mentioned as a related technique that utilizes memoization to solve problems with overlapping subproblems.

 4. MLP Memoization
- Application in Neural Networks:
  - Discussed in the context of neural networks, focusing on its application to backpropagation.
- Backpropagation Complexity:
  - Involves calculating derivatives of weights in a neural network to update them during training.
  - Complex, especially with multiple paths for information flow.
- Efficiency Improvement:
  - Memoization significantly improves the efficiency of backpropagation by storing previously calculated derivatives and reusing them when needed.
  - Avoids redundant calculations, saving time and computational resources.
