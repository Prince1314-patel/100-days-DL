 Notes on Nesterov Accelerated Gradient (NAG) from the Video

 1. Introduction to Optimization Techniques in Deep Learning
- Purpose: Optimization techniques are critical in deep learning to find the optimal parameters of a model, which helps improve the model's performance.
- Context: The speaker introduces optimization techniques as a foundation for enhancing model training efficiency and effectiveness.

 2. Explanation of Momentum
- Definition: Momentum is an optimization technique designed to accelerate the convergence process.
- Functionality: 
  - Update Mechanism: It works by adding a fraction of the previous update to the current update, which helps to smooth out oscillations.
  - Benefits: 
    - Reduces oscillations in the optimization process.
    - Helps in faster convergence, especially in complex optimization landscapes.

 3. Overview of Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD)
- Definition: SGD is a straightforward and widely used optimization algorithm, often serving as a baseline for comparison.
- Working Principle: 
  - Gradient Calculation: It updates the model's parameters in the direction of the negative gradient of the loss function.
  - Challenges: 
    - Oscillations: Due to its simplicity, SGD may suffer from slow convergence and oscillations, particularly in non-convex loss functions.

 4. Comparison Between SGD and Momentum
- Momentum's Advantage: 
  - Enhanced Convergence: By incorporating momentum, the optimization process can converge more quickly than using SGD alone.
  - Non-Convex Optimization: Momentum is particularly beneficial in non-convex loss functions, helping to navigate complex optimization 
    landscapes more effectively.
