 ReLU Variants Explained

---

 Introduction
- Continuation of Activation Functions: The video is a sequel to an earlier one discussing activation functions like Sigmoid, Tanh, and ReLU.
- Focus: This video examines the limitations of ReLU and explores its variants, including Leaky ReLU, Parametric ReLU, ELU, and SELU.

 Dying ReLU Problem
- Overview: The Dying ReLU problem occurs when neurons become inactive by consistently outputting zero, rendering them ineffective.
- Causes:
  - Negative inputs to neurons cause the ReLU to output zero.
  - Zero gradients result in no updates to weights and biases, leading to dead neurons.
- Consequences:
  - A large number of dead neurons can significantly degrade neural network performance.
  - In extreme cases, a network with all dead neurons becomes non-functional.

 Solutions to the Dying ReLU Problem
- Adjusting Learning Parameters:
  - Lowering the learning rate can prevent large negative weights.
  - Setting a positive bias ensures neurons receive positive inputs.
- Using ReLU Variants:
  - Linear ReLU Variants: Leaky ReLU and Parametric ReLU modify the ReLU function linearly.
  - Non-linear ReLU Variants: ELU and SELU introduce non-linear transformations to tackle the problem.

 Leaky ReLU
- Introduction: Leaky ReLU introduces a small slope (typically 0.01) for negative inputs, ensuring neurons don’t become entirely inactive.
- Functionality: Allows for a small gradient flow even when inputs are negative, thus mitigating the Dying ReLU problem.

 Parametric ReLU
- Overview: Similar to Leaky ReLU, but the slope parameter 'a' for negative inputs is learned during training.
- Advantages:
  - Offers the same benefits as ReLU but adds flexibility through the learnable parameter.
  - Can outperform ReLU by adapting better to specific datasets.

 Exponential Linear Unit (ELU)
- Mechanism: ELU outputs `α(e^x - 1)` for negative inputs, with `α` typically between 0.1 and 0.3.
- Benefits:
  - Continuous and differentiable, leading to smoother training.
  - Zero-centered output, improving convergence.
  - Often performs better than ReLU in various datasets.

 Scaled Exponential Linear Unit (SELU)
- Introduction: SELU scales the output of ELU with experimentally determined factors.
- Key Feature: SELU is self-normalizing, which helps prevent vanishing or exploding gradients during training.
- Current Status: Although promising, SELU is still relatively new and not widely adopted due to limited research.
